# digitalWatch
A digital watch to be used for time bound purposes.


# Description : 

I created a digital watch with the help of Java's Spring-Boot framework and the Maven Build Tool <br>
along with the use of Html, Css and the Javascript in or der to provide it a responsive UI. <br>
 
# Motivation : 

I saw a recent hackathon video where I got to see that the developers were given an idea and  <br>
then they have to decide and plan out a complete web application. <br>

Now when a time bound event goes on then the tenacity to complete a full <br>
end to end project to be displayed at the end of the hackathon.

Planning Time  : 30 minutes <br>
Developing Time : 4 hours <br>

The end result was that every developer was able to come out with a new idea <br>
and they demonstrated their amazing ideas in front of everyone which was quite <br>
a meaningful session overall.
